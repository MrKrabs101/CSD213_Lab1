LAB 1 - My Portfolio
Author: Ashutosh Mishra

Keyword: HTML, Javascrpt


This is a simple project using HTML and Javacript where the purpose was to insert and delete rows in a given table. Couple of lines in the code was inspired by ChatGPT but I managed to tweak it and made it my own.
This lab project helped me learn a lot. For example i got to know that textContent is a builtin property of DOM in javascript. However I was reliable on ChatGPT for this project but I aim to be less dependent on AI from the next project.

Thank you.
